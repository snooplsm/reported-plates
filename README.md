# Reported - NYC 311 & NY TLC Complaint Simplifier

## About
This web app focuses on bridging the gap between NYC 311 and NY TLC. It simplifies the process of reporting reckless driving or other infractions by requiring only a photo of the incident. If safely possible, include the license plate in the photo.

Demo can be found [here](https://snooplsm.github.io/reported-plates)

The app automatically extracts:
- **License Plate** information
- **Date of Incident**
- **GPS Coordinates**

Once these data points are collected, simply choose the appropriate **complaint type**, and the app will handle the rest. The report is funneled into the appropriate channels for **311**, **TLC**, or **NYPD** to address.

Thank you for helping to make our streets safer by holding reckless drivers accountable!
